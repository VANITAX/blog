Jon Hainstock 在 twitter 上快速回顧一些想法
- **Spent less time overthinking.**
  - Not every decision is worth a conversation. Action cures fear.
- **Spent less time worrying about metrics.**
  - Analytics tools are never perfectly accurate. Establish a baseline and don't obsess over the numbers.
- **Spent less time trying shiny tools.**
  - There is no such thing as a perfect stack.
  - Don't optimize for future problems.
- **Spent less time on major releases**.
  - Working without shipping is demoralizing. Work in shorter cycles. Make smaller bets.
  - It's okay if the codebase isn't perfect—it never will be.
- **Spent more time enjoying the wins.**
  - Slow down. Be grateful for the stage you're in.
  - The next milestone won't make you happy.
- **Spent more time connecting with customers.**
  - Some of my fondest memories were getting to know our customers and visiting them in person.
- **Spent more time on help docs.**
  - We could have prevented a lot of support tickets by doing this.
- **Spent more time on content and strategy.**
  - Chatting with @JHTScherck sooner about this would have been smart.
- **Spent time documenting the journey.**
  - I wish I had a way to replay things we were thinking about and experienced.
  - Founder journey podcasts like @artofproductpod and @buildyoursaas are fantastic for this.
- **Experimented more with plans and pricing.**
  - Charging more isn't always the answer.
  - But a small price or plan changes can make a big impact.
- **Hired a great customer support representative sooner.**
  - Brooke, you're the best, and I miss you.
- Not bought business cards.
- **Not hired an agency to do "link building."**
  - Gosh, this was dumb. I hate getting these emails. Why on earth did I pay for someone to send them to other people ?
- **SEO was a big channel for us.**
  - On-page optimizations made the biggest impact.

## why you decide to sell it?
- In short, it was a good deal. I felt it was time to take some chips off the table and start a new game.
