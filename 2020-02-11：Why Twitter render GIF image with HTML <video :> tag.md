## WebM
**WebM** format which offers high quality videos, often comparable to an **MP4**  

but, need to consider support (e.x. IE11 not support)
- https://caniuse.com/#search=WebM

you need to make sure that whatever **ffmpeg** build you install is compiled with **libvpx**.

```bash
ffmpeg -i animated.gif -c vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 41 video.webm
```

## HTML
This tells the browser to choose from the provided video files depending on format support. In this case, the WebM video will be downloaded and played if itâ€™s supported, otherwise the MP4 file is used instead.

```html
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="video.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

To make this more robust for older browsers which do not support HTML5 video, you could add some HTML content linking to the original GIF file as a fallback.
```html
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="video.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <img src="animated.gif">
</video>
```
